According to the results shown in rpk_sample_2.png, fuel efficiency 
(measured as CO₂ emissions per kilometer) gets worse when the load factor is below 50%. 
However, it improves quickly once the load factor goes above that point. 
This is likely because airplanes use a large amount of fuel regardless of how many passengers are on board. 
As more passengers are added, the total CO₂ emissions are shared across more seat-kilometers, which makes the flight more efficient.

For this reason, flying with a load factor below 50% is not a reasonable choice from either an environmental 
or economic perspective. In such cases, strategies like code-sharing or combining flights should be considered to increase passenger numbers.

It may also be useful to check whether this trend is different depending on the type of aircraft.
The baseline input used in the simulation was selected at random. 
To make the results more realistic, it would be better to use an example that reflects 
either the most common case or an actual observation from the dataset.
